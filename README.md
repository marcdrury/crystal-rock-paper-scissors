## How to Play ##
When the program starts it will prompt the player to enter `rock`, `paper` or
`scissors`. This is case-insensitive. The computer opponent will then randomly
chose an option. After that the choices of both the player and the computer
will be displayed, followed by the result of the matchup. If the round ends in
a draw an additional round will be started automatically until either the player
or the computer wins.
